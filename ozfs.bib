	shorttitle = {How to Make a Zoning Atlas},
	abstract = {Zoning – the regulation of land uses, structures, and lots through distinctly-regulated districts – is the most important, yet most underappreciated, power of local governments.  Adopted by perhaps 30,000 local governments across the country, zoning laws directly impact housing availability, transportation, education, the food supply, economic opportunity, and access to nature.  We must expand public understanding of zoning codes.  To achieve that goal, we propose an online, user-friendly map that illustrates key features of zoning codes all over the country:  a National Zoning Atlas.  A National Zoning Atlas will enable comparisons across jurisdictions, illuminate regional and statewide trends, and strengthen national planning for housing production, transportation infrastructure, and climate response.  It will also broaden participation in land use decisions, identify opportunities for zoning reform, and narrow a wide information gap that currently favors land speculators, institutional investors, and homeowners over socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.  We have explained more at www.zoningatlas.org.  This methodology has two purposes:  first, to help you translate and standardize zoning information for your own regional or statewide atlas; and second, to ensure your atlas is compatible with and can be merged into the National Zoning Atlas.  Part {II} explains how the project manager should set up your team, your files, your spreadsheet, and your division of labor.  Part {III} then turns to the building blocks of any zoning atlas:  zoning districts.  For reasons explained below, the seemingly simple task of listing zoning districts is harder than it appears.  It is useful for the whole project team (including the geospatial analysts) to engage in this task.  Part {IV} provides instructions on how the zoning code analysts should classify zoning districts into certain categories.  It also covers the substantive regulation of uses, lots, and structures. Part V explains how the geospatial analysts can set up a map and includes instructions on cleaning and merging geospatial files.  As noted above, we hope to raise sufficient funds to centralize this step, but in the interim, this information can get teams started.  Part {VI} concludes, with a few tips on how to verify and maintain your data, once collected.},

Economists and other experts who favor increases in supply have failed to take these supply skeptics seriously. But left unanswered, supply skepticism is likely to continue to feed local opposition to housing construction, and further increase the prevalence and intensity of land-use regulations that limit construction. This article is meant to bridge the divide, addressing each of the key arguments supply skeptics make and reviewing what research has shown about housing supply and its effect on affordability. We ultimately conclude, from both theory and empirical evidence, that adding new homes moderates price increases and therefore makes housing more affordable to low- and moderate-income families. We argue further that there are additional reasons to be concerned about inadequate supply response and assess the evidence on those effects of limiting supply, including preventing workers from moving to areas with growing job opportunities. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing that new market-rate housing is necessary but not sufficient. Government intervention is critical  to ensure that supply is added at prices affordable to a range of incomes.},

	abstract = {Local planning in the United States is unique in the amount of land it reserves for detached single-family homes. This privileging of single-family homes, normally called R1 zoning, exacerbates inequality and undermines efficiency. R1’s origins are unpleasant: Stained by explicitly classist and implicitly racist motivations, R1 today continues to promote exclusion. It makes it harder for people to access high-opportunity places, and in expensive regions it contributes to shortages of housing, thereby benefiting homeowners at the expense of renters and forcing many housing consumers to spend more on housing. Stacked against these drawbacks, moreover, are a series of only weak arguments in R1’s favor about preferences, aesthetics, and a single-family way of life. We demonstrate that these pro-R1 concerns are either specious, or can be addressed in ways less socially harmful than R1. Given the strong arguments against R1 and the weak arguments for it, we contend planners should work to abolish R1 single-family zoning.},

Based on primary and secondary archival sources, this paper tells a story about two aspects of zoning that set U.S. practice apart from that in Europe. The first is the purely residential district and the second is the purely single-family residential district.

	shorttitle = {Exclusionary Zoning},
	abstract = {In light of recent debate over upzonings and leveraging markets as means of expanding housing opportunity, I review the evolution of exclusionary zoning practices in the United States and provide an intellectual history of scholars’ research into these practices. In the context of early 20th-century racial and class tension, American elites coveted the ability to use the states’ police powers to sort out cities by housing type and gained this ability with legislative and judicial support for local land use zoning schemes that controlled residential densities and building forms. Many 20th-century U.S. planners upheld the resulting socially sorted city as an ideal outcome of good zoning practice. But in the postwar decades, a new breed of equity-focused advocacy planner sought to address racial ghettoization by using zoning reforms and other measures to open exclusive areas to low- and moderate-income housing. Wider shifts in housing policy since the 1970s and the increasing attention of economic scholarship to the myriad impacts of American zoning practices have, however, diluted the original equity-focused agenda of exclusionary zoning scholarship. Given the need for a common effort against business-as-usual zoning in the United States, planners can assert the ethics of the planning profession in debates about American zoning practices. Scholarly and professional efforts to dismantle exclusionary zoning can return to their roots in housing advocacy, becoming one part of a multipronged agenda aimed at expanding housing opportunity by a variety of means.},

Most existing research on housing opposition focuses on subsidized affordable housing, rather than new market-rate development. Scholars also tend to examine opponents’ stated concerns, which often overlap and may obscure their underlying motivations. This article uses a survey-framing experiment, administered to over 1,300 people in Los Angeles County, to isolate different arguments against new market-rate housing and measure their relative persuasive power. We test the impact of common anti-housing arguments, such as traffic congestion, but also introduce the idea that residents might dislike development because they dislike developers. We find strong evidence for this idea: opposition to new development increases by 20 percentage points when respondents learn that a developer is likely to earn a large profit. This effect is similar in magnitude to arguments that new housing will harm neighborhood character. Our findings show that some opposition to housing is motivated not by residents’ fears of their own losses, but resentment of others’ gains.},

A review of 22 major central cities shows that they captured only 5.2 percent of total new metropolitan housing permits over the decade: 2.2 percent of single‐family pemits and 14.9 percent of multifamily permits. This analysis identifies the practical barriers to urban infill development, including land assembly and infrastructure costs, unwillingness to condemn, municipal social goal and regulatory policies, difficulty of finding developers, complexities of public‐private partnerships, excessive risks, resistance from local residents, and stakeholder conflicts and political constraints. While supporting infill, smart growth advocates should focus primarily on encouraging higher‐density, quality suburban and outlying growth.},

We then develop a schema for determining appropriate infill housing densities based on transit service availability, local land use mix and character, and initial neighborhood densities. We use this schema to generate local, county, and statewide estimates of infill housing potential. These are then carefully evaluated in terms of their parcel size and financial feasibility, the likelihood that construction will displace existing low‐income renters, and the contribution to cumulative overdevelopment.

	abstract = {Several U.S. states with high housing costs have recently adopted laws intended to promote infill development. These new laws expand state agencies’ supervisory responsibilities to ensure that local governments comply with state mandates. Effective administration of these laws will require state agencies to accurately estimate the amount of new housing that might be created and to target review to the jurisdictions that are failing to meet the relevant requirements. Here we present quantitative tools both for prioritizing review of local plans and zoning ordinances and for estimating future housing development. We applied the tools to the implementation of California laws requiring local governments to amend their zoning ordinances to allow accessory dwelling units on parcels zoned for detached single-family housing development. We provide computer code, written in the open-source statistical computing language R, that implements these tools. Although we present off-the-shelf tools, our proposed tools should supplement other regulatory techniques rather than serving as a substitute. Requirements for local governments to allow infill development should be accompanied by mandates for data collection. With good data, state agencies can use open-source statistical software to create quantitative measures that can help estimate future housing production and set priorities for reviewing local plans and zoning ordinances.},

	abstract = {Infill development policies have been widely adopted as strategies to reduce urban sprawl and to promote sustainable urban transformation. However, little empirical data are available to analyse infill processes and to facilitate building activity on infill potentials. This is especially true for small-scale residential infill, which often takes place on vacant or underused lots as soft densification. To address this issue, a geospatial method is presented that enables automatic detection of vacant lots for large areas. Cadastral data are used to analyse spatio-temporal development for the period 2011\&ndash;21 in a German study area, containing large cites as well as rural municipalities. The results show that every fourth vacant lot was mobilised since 2011. However, additional vacant lots emerged in rural areas as new residential development areas are not fully built-up, resulting in a net increase of vacant lots. Although the quantity of vacant lot areas in 2021 suggests a high potential for residential infill, the main development on these infill sites is expected to promote additional single-family housing rather than more dense structures.
Practice relevance
Automatic identification and monitoring of infill potentials and development are important both for policymaking and for local planning practitioners. For small municipalities with little financial capacities, the approach can provide an overview of their vacant lots and can serve as a basis for strategic planning decisions. For the regional or national level, a yearly monitoring schedule can be established at little cost. Although the approach proves to be robust regarding its precision and is promising for a nationwide application, the data availability for the whole of Germany is awaited and the method needs to be optimised to implement the workflow in practice.},

These tools transform raw data into accessible information displays designed to inform specific actions by private, nonprofit and government actors, and may range from simple web tables to more complex analytic processes. This paper reviews early experiences in developing such tools in five cities (as part of a Brookings Urban Markets Initiative pilot project) and concludes that they have great promise. The choice of tools will depend on local market conditions, but in all areas, they can help in: (1) assessing trends and need for intervention; (2) deciding on the appropriate interventions for individual properties; and (3) program monitoring and coordination. Ideas are offered as to how local leaders can create an environment conducive to capitalizing on the potential of these tools and avoiding risks that could hinder their effective use.},

	abstract = {Urban areas across the Unites States are facing a housing affordability crisis. One approach some cities and states have taken is to reduce or eliminate single-family zoning. Single-family zoning prevents the construction of more-affordable apartments in vast swaths of the American urban landscape. This policy shift has already occurred in Minneapolis, Sacramento, and Oregon, and is under discussion in California, Massachusetts, and North Carolina, among others.
Independent of any effects on housing affordability, changes to land use will have effects on transport. I evaluate these effects using a microsimulation framework. In order for land use policies to have an effect on transport, they need to first have an effect on land use, so I first build an economic model to simulate where development will occur given a loosening of single-family zoning. Transport outcomes will vary depending on which households live in which parts of the region, so I use an equilibrium sorting model to forecast how residents will re-sort across the region in response to the land use changes induced by new land-use policies. This model also jointly forecasts how many vehicles each household will choose to own. Finally, I apply an activity-based travel demand microsimulation model to forecast the changes in transport associated with the forecast changes from the previous models.
I find that while there is opportunity for economically-feasible redevelopment of single-family homes into multifamily structures, the amount of redevelopment that will occur varies greatly depending on the exact expectations of developers about future market conditions. Redevelopment is focused in higher-income neighborhoods.
The transport effects of the redevelopment are minimal. Average car ownership across the region does not change hardly at all, although residents of new housing units do have somewhat lower car ownership. Vehicles kilometers traveled, mode choice, and congestion change very little as well. This does not mean that upzoning does not affect transport in general, but that more nuanced proposals may be necessary to promote desirable transport outcomes. Alternatively, the results suggest that upzoning will not worsen transport outcomes, promising for those who support upzoning on affordability grounds.},

As an alternative, we constructed a National Zoning and Land Use Database using natural language processing techniques on publicly available administrative data. We show this new database and our parsimonious measure of exclusionary zoning, the Zoning Restrictiveness Index, to be consistent with the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index (2018) and the National Longitudinal Land Use Survey (2019). Additionally, we overcome other limitations of these survey approaches, both by capturing previously omitted and important elements of land use policy and by revealing the land use regulations for a near-universe of municipalities in the San Francisco and Houston metropolitan statistical areas. We make all code and data publicly available, allowing the National Zoning and Land Use Database to be replicated in future years to ensure accurate, up-to-date and longitudinal nationwide zoning and land use data.},

Housing shortages are considered to limit migration into thriving cities, curtailing their expansion potential, generating rising social and spatial inequalities and inhibiting national growth. According to this dominant view, relaxing zoning and other planning regulations in the most prosperous cities is crucial to unleash the economic potential of cities and nations and to facilitate within-country migration. In this article, we contend that the bulk of the claims of the housing as opportunity approach are fundamentally flawed and lead to simplistic and misguided policy recommendations. We posit that there is no clear and uncontroversial evidence that housing regulation is a principal source of differences in home availability or prices across cities. Blanket changes in zoning are unlikely to increase domestic migration or to improve affordability for lower-income households in prosperous areas. They would, however, increase gentrification within metropolitan areas and would not appreciably decrease income inequality. In contrast to the housing models, we argue that the basic motors of all these features of the economy are the current geography of employment, wages and skills.},

We take issue with both of these contentions. While uncertainties remain in the study of housing prices and land use regulation, neither theory nor evidence warrant dispensing with zoning reform, or concluding that it could only be regressive. Viewed in full, the evidence suggests that increasing allowable housing densities is an important part of housing affordability in expensive regions.},

A consequence of these efforts is residential segregation between cities along racial lines. I provide evidence that more stringent land use regulations are supported by whiter communities and that they preserve racial homogeneity. First, I show that cities that were whiter than their metropolitan area in 1970 are more likely to have restrictive land use patterns in 2006. Then, relying on Federal Fair Housing Act lawsuits to generate changes in land use policy, I show that restrictive land use helps to explain metropolitan area segregation patterns over time. Finally, I draw on precinct level initiative elections from several California cities to show that whiter neighborhoods are more supportive of restricting development. These results strongly suggest that even facially race-neutral land use policies have contributed to racial segregation.},

We find that cities that require a greater number of independent reviews to obtain a building permit or a zoning change have higher land prices, ceteris paribus. Finally, we relate the variation in land prices to the prices paid for housing in the region and show that local land use regulations are closely linked to the value of houses sold.

	shorttitle = {The Effects of Land Use Regulation on the Price of Housing},
	abstract = {Effective governance of residential development and housing markets poses difficult challenges for land regulators. In theory, excessive land restrictions limit the buildable supply, tilting construction toward lower densities and larger, more expensive homes. Often, local prerogative and regional need conflict, and policymakers must make tradeoffs carefully. When higher income incumbents control the political processes by which local planning and zoning decisions are made, regions can become less affordable as prices increase. Housing assistance programs meant to benefit lower income households could be frustrated by limits on density and other restrictions on the number and size of new units. The empirical literature on the effects of regulation on housing prices varies widely in quality of research method and strength of result. A number of credible papers seem to bear out theoretical expectations. When local regulators effectively withdraw land from buildable supplies—whether under the rubric of "zoning," "growth management," or other regulation—the land factor and the finished product can become pricier. Caps on development, restrictive zoning limits on allowable densities, urban growth boundaries, and long permit-processing delays have all been associated with increased housing prices. The literature fails, however, to establish a strong, direct causal effect, if only because variations in both observed regulation and methodological precision frustrate sweeping generalizations. A substantial number of land use and growth control studies show little or no effect on price, implying that sometimes, local regulation is symbolic, ineffectual, or only weakly enforced. The literature as a whole also fails to address key empirical challenges. First, most studies ignore the "endogeneity" of regulation and price (for example, a statistical association may show regulatory effect or may just show that wealthier, more expensive communities have stronger tastes for such regulation). Second, research tends not to recognize the complexity of local policymaking and regulatory behavior. For example, enactments promoting growth and development, often present in the same jurisdictions where zoning restrictions are observed, are rarely measured or analyzed. Third, regulatory surveys are administered sparsely and infrequently. Current studies are often forced to rely on outdated land use proxies and static observations of housing price movements. Fourth, few studies utilize sophisticated price indexes, such as those measuring repeat sales of individual properties. Such methods correct for well-known biases in price means and medians typically reported. An agenda for future research in the area of regulatory effects on price should address these shortcomings and generate replicable findings relevant for policy reform efforts. Ideally, a national regulatory census would measure at regular intervals municipal enactments and implementation patterns. The most demanding aspect of this task is the development of standard regulatory indexes facilitating comparison at the municipal level and allowing for aggregation to the metropolitan and state levels. Over time, this survey should help describe changes in antecedent law and resulting land policy behavior so that time series encompassing regulation and price can be compiled. Existing building permit surveys can be adapted to facilitate this effort. Regular reporting from developers and builders regarding their experiences with local regulatory processes should then complement the census of laws and behaviors. An additional source of information would be a regularly refreshed, national land use survey, mapping in some detail the ever-changing patterns of residential and other development in metropolitan areas. Early efforts to improve and expand research should focus primarily on the deliberate, painstaking development of better, more current data. When better data are available, the existing community of scholars will develop methods providing more reliable tests of hypotheses about the link between regulation and the well-being of housing consumers.},
